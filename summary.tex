\section{Summary and outlook\label{sec:summary} }
We have presented the design, construction, and performance of the \gx{} experiment in Hall D at Jefferson Lab during its first phase of operation. The experiment operated routinely at an incident photon flux of $2\times 10^{7}$ photons/s in the coherent peak\footnote{Defined as 0.6 GeV below the coherent edge, nominally 9 GeV, which varied somewhat depending on the primary incident electron beam energy.} with an open trigger, taking data at 40 kHz, and recording 600 MB/s to tape with live time $>$95\%. During this period the experiment accumulated  121.4 pb$^{-1}$ in the coherent peak and 319.4 pb$^{-1}$ total for $E_\gamma>$8.1 GeV. Data were collected in two sets of orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident photons, with $\sim$23\% of the data in each of the four orientations. The remaining $\sim$11\% was collected with unpolarized photons. We accumulated approximately 270 billion triggers during this period, as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:plot_rcdb3_phaseI}.

We have verified the operational characteristics of the charged and neutral particle detectors, trigger, DAQ, online and offline systems, and checked that individual components performed as designed. We have also demonstrated that the detector is able to reconstruct exclusive final states, determined reconstruction efficiencies, and validated our Monte Carlo simulation against data. The infrastructure is in place to process our high volume of data both on the JLab computing farm as well on other offsite facilities. The use of these tools gives us the ability to process the data in a timely fashion.

Future running will include taking data at higher luminosity  and with improved particle identification capability. The \gx~experiment has already implemented the necessary infrastructure to allow the experiment to operate at a flux of $5\times10^{7}$ photons/s in the coherent peak for the upcoming run periods and has added a new DIRC detector\footnote{Four ``bar boxes" from the BaBar DIRC\cite{Aubert:2001tu} detector have been installed and tested.} to extend particle identification of kaons to higher momenta.
